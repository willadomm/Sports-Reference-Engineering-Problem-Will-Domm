# Sports-Reference-Engineering-Problem-Will-Domm

Hi! This is my solution to the fun little problem that was the Engineering Code prompt. I had a lot of fun with this. Once I realized that the wins for the New York Giants against the Brookyln Dodgers are also the losses for the Dodgers against the Giants, my solution was clear. My code iterates through each team in the json dictionary, and then steps into the subdictionary to find a single number for the amount of wins against a specific team. It accumulates all of those win numbers for a single team, against each other team, into an array. The next step is to then insert a dash into the array, at the index of where the team is in the list of teams in alphabetical order. This is so that when printing the dataframe, the intersection of two of the same team on both axises will just have a dash instead of a number. My code then saves that array to a new dictionary, with the name of the team as the key. From there, I knew that printing the dataframe would be easy with pandas, and that it was just a matter of manually adding in a new index label, to get both the rows and columns to be team names, and transposing the data. It was quite satisfying!
